    "name": "Red Imperial Astromech Droids",
    "notes": "These loot droids can be found in random locations across the entire map, including inside wrecked cars and on top of buildings. To unlock them, you need the matching color Datacard. These datacards are created by combining a matching color Star Map with an Empty Datacard. Star Maps and Empty Datacards can both be found inside the Imperial Bunker in the toxic zone. Empty Datacards can also be found as loot on red or black B1 Battle Droids. It is best practice to put a round into the droid after you loot it, so it's status shows as red/ruined. This is to ensure a faster despawn. The Red droids typically drop one or two pieces of character armor sets, a single Jedi or Sith Medallion, and an Overkill lightsaber.",
